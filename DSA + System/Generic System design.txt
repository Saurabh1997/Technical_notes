Start with something as simple as this - users -> load balancer -> service -> database. Talk about the functionalities and problem statement and then gradually add components as needed.

Here's a few very generic examples:-
Need async communication between services? Add queues.
Need faster read response times from DB? Think of replicas.
Need search functionality? Introduce ElasticSearch.
Need analytics? Push to Amplitude.
