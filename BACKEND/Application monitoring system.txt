application monitoring system - 

observability of an application. 3 pillars - logs, monitoring & traces. 


For setting up logging system , 3 tools we can use -

1. winston - logging library with multiple logging levels for multiple transports. it will generate log files.

2. Promtail - agent which ships the contents of a local logs to private Grafana loki instance or Grafana cloud. basically service reading log file & uploading all logs to grafana instance. 

3. Grafana Cloud -  observability platform. integrating metrics, traces n logs with grafana.

Prometheus - open source systems monitoring & alerting toolkit. prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data. metrics info is stored with the timestamp. changes are recorded over time. 
Express-prometheus-Middleware - middleware for prometheus that expose metrics for prometheus. Metrics exposed allows to calculate common RED (Request, Error rate, Duration of requests) n USE (utilization, saturation, n error rate).
