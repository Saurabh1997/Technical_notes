Vertical scaling - increasing the size of machine to support more load. nodejs won't be able to fully utilize vertical scaling as compared to a Multi-threaded language like java, Golang, Rust.  
	In Rust we spawn threads to fully utilize vertical scaling. in Go, we have subroutine. in Java we have threads. 
	In Nodejs we can use cluster module to spawn more nodejs app to fully utilize our CPU. but this spawning is not much light weight as much as a goroutine. 
	
	for loop till os.cpus().length, 
		can do cluster.fork().
		
	
	
Horizontal scaling - we are increasing number of machines.
