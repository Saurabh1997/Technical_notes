------------------TAILWIND CSS-------------------------------

postCSS - tool to transform CSS . to understand tailwind. 
There are lot of utility classes to create custom designs without writing css. 

1. Responsive - can't use media queries but we have 5 types of breakpoint prefixes designed for each screen resolution. 
BREAKPOINT PREFIXES  - sm, md , sxl, xl, 2xl

can use modifiers for states such as hover, selection. also can use ::After and ::before. 
can use first:css and last:css in a loop where we have a list. 
hover:bg-color. 
can change color of highlight by doing selection:bg-color.

It prefers color scheme based on the OS dark/white mode selected by user. 
can specify color of dark mode by using dark:bg-color.

Tailwind CSS is customizable and extensible. can define custom styles, custom color palletes, typography, screen by adding them as a normal variable like mixins inside of themes of tailwind.config.js. 
-- can extend styling of tailwind css by using extend. 

themes : {
screens: {
sm:"480px"
},
colors: {
'blue': 'colorcode'
}
extend: {
spacing : {
128: '32rem' }}
}


-- If we want to keep the base layer css as it is for the html, body css and update css for specific elements, then :
We can do something like :
	@layer base {
		h1 {
			@apply text-2xl;
		}
	}
	
--COLUMNS ---
	for equal widths - use grid-cols-3
	for unequal widths - grid-cols-12 // 12 columns
					and set cols-span-5 // will take space of 5 spans for a cols.

--MOBILE-FIRST APPROACH - 
	Tailwind CSS works mobile first. Never use sm for mobile screens. default css will be used mobile screens. 
		TO ASSIGN FOR MORE SCREEN WIDTH - CAN USE SM, MD, LG AND 2XL. 	

PROS:
Tailwind is very light weight. if we use m-3 class everywhere, only once it will be imported while bundling. it keeps bundle size very small.
