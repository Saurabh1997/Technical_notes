sass and scss 
sass - syntactically awesome style sheets. scss - for css3. sass - css

sass supports 2 different syntaxes. 1. SCSS - superset of CSS filename have .scss ext.  
2. Indented syntax -  called as sass and file ext - .sass. instead of curly braces & semicolons, it uses indentations. 

why sass is better than css  
- operators (+, -), Variables ($varname) - can reuse this anywhere using $varname
- nesting css -         p   {  &:hover : prop}
- mixins - structure similar to functions. 
- partials - importing variables from other files, for distributing sass files

@mixin flexprob {
write all attributes
}

while using mixin - 
.h1-header {
@include flexprob;
}

for passing making dynamic mixin -    @mixin flexprob($a) { }
for using, @include flexprob(0.2rem)

for making partials, we will have to name sass files beginning with _nameoffile.scss. 
to import that file, @import "mixin";

rem - root em. 1 rem equals font size of the root html element. 
NOTE : 1 REM =  16px.  FOR ADJUSTING TO 1 REM = 10 PX,   HTML { FONT-SIZE : 10 PX} or html {font-size: 62.5%}

em - are relative to font size of own element, while rem - root elememt. 


Z-INDEX -  CSS PROP THAT CONTROLS STACKING ORDER OF OVERLAPPING ELEMENTS ON A PAGE. AN ELEMENT WITH HIGHEST INDEX WILL APPEAR IN FRONT OF ELEMENT WITH LOWER INDEX.
IT WILL BASICALLY SHIFT AFTER LOWER z-index.
z-index -1 is basically it will position behind all parental elememts. 
IT ONLY WORKS ON POSITIONED ELEMENTS - ABSOLUTE, RELATIVE, FIXED. 

Tailwind CSS - Wrapper for css. 
Radix - gives complex components like modal, side panel. unstyled components.
Chakra - combindation of tailwind and Material UI
Shadcn - doesn't require npm install. use combination of tailwind and Radix.. 
		gives a single file and copy them in the code. just have to copy paste.
