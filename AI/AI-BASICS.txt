------------------------------TYPES OF AI ------------------------------

1. AI - capacity for machines to perform tasks which require some human intelligence like data processing, image processing, robotics.
2. Data science to leverage AI on data. used for general statistics and general model building.
3. ML - trains model to identify and predict patterns based on human processed data.
4. Deep learning -    powerfull and advanced ML to improve model performance without feature engineering. 
5. 





-------------------------GENERATIVE AI------------------------------------
TYPE OF AI WHICH GENERATES NEW ORIGINAL CONTEXT BASED SET OF DATA AND RULES.  POWERED BY FOUNDATIONAL MODELS - GPT4, NVIDIA'S MEGATRON, 
-can generate complex text, art, music and even code.
-Improvement of human computer interaction. 
- self programming machines. 

	mechanism - 
		1. OUTPUT - Application like gpt generate content (text, code, music, art) based on how their models were trained as well as user inputs.
		2. PREDICTION - GENERATIVE AI MODEL - mimicking inputs to generate outputs. models generate outputs based on their understanding of human generated inputs.
		3. MODELS - they process vast amount of data inputs. they use neural networks to learn patterns from huge amount of data & store the information to use it to generate original content.
		4. CLOUD & DATA PLATFORM - where data is stored.
		5. COMPUTE POWER - scale of compute power capacity needed to train and process foundational models. 
	
3 major components - 
	1. foundational models - building block to create genAI models. 
	2. Developer tools- packages, managed services, model hubs, frameworks to build own GenAI based on the usecase
	4. Application - client facing 

MULTIPLE TYPES OF FOUNDATIONAL MODELS FROM TEXT-BASED LANGUAGE LEARNING MODELS (LLMS) to audio, video, multimodal generators. 
Google - Lambda - language model for diagogue application. Palm 2, Bert 
		Bard is built on Lambda. 
Anthropic , Meta - Llama, 

SOUTH KOREA'S - GIGA GENIE IS BUILT ON NVIDIA'S NEMO MEGATRON FRAMEWORK.
