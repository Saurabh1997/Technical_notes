----------------------RUST-------------------------------------------

rust modern systems programming language which focusses on speed, concurrency and safety. it is memory safe without using garbage collection. 
println! - macro that prints text to the console. MACROS ARE FUNCTIONS WHICH ENDS WITH ! AND THEY ARE EXPANDED INTO THEIR SOURCE CODE WHICH GETS COMPILED WITH THE REST OF THE PROGRAM.
 RUST PROVIDES A MACRO SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS METAPROGRAMMING -  
 METAPROGRAMMING - PROGRAMS CAN BE DESIGNED TO READ, TRANSFORM OTHER PROGRAMS N MODIFY ITSELF. 

FORMATTED PRINTING -     println!("{0}, this is {1}. {1}, this is {0}", "Alice", "Bob");

rustc program.rs  - to compile.

to disable dead_code which is not used.    #[allow(dead_code)] // disable `dead_code` which warn against unused module

-------------STRUCTS---------------
3 TYPES OF STRUCTS -- 
	1. CLASS C STRUCTS  - DIFFERENT SET OF DATA TYPES GROUPED 
		struct Person {
			name: String,
			age: u8
			}
			
			
	2. Unit structs fieldless and used for generics. 
		struct Unit;
