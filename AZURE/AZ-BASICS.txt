CLOUD COMPUTING - DELIVERY OF COMPUTING SERVICES OVER THE INTERNET, ENABLING FASTER INNOVATION, FLEXIBLE SERVICES & SCALING OF ECONOMY.
COMPUTING, NETWORKING AND STORAGE. 

3 types of cloud - public cloud, private cloud & hybrid. 
public is accessed via internet. it provides resources to organizations & users
	no capital exp to scale up. org pay for what they use. 

private - single organization has total control. they create a cloud env in their data center. doesn't provide service to user outside of org.
			hardware must be purchased for start-up & maintanance. 
			
hybrid combines public and private. most flexible. 

capex - upfront spending of money on physical infra. costs from capex have value that reduces overtime. 
Opex - operational expend... spend on products & services as needed,pay as you go. get billed immediately.  mostly used by public cloud. 

BENEFIT OF ECONOMIES AT SCALE - PRICES OF CLOUD SERVERS AND SERVICES ARE ALWAYS GOING DOWN. IT'LL BE CHEAPER NEXT YEAR. 
benefit of economies of scale - the more you buy of something, the cheaper it is for you per unit. 

benefits - high availability, scalability -	vertically up/down - increase RAM. horizontally - means adding/removing of resources as per the demand, elasticity - to scale automatically.
reliability, predictability - for cost estimation, security, governance, manageability. 
Availability - what percentage of time does a system respond properly to requests, expressed as a percentage over time

default amount of credits when we create azure free account = 200USD

type of service

IAAS - infrastructure - servers,storage, networking security/firewalls. pay as you go.  MOST FLEXIBLE. CAN CONFIGURE AND MANAGE HARDWARE FOR APPLICATION. VM comes under this..
PAAS - PLATFORM as a service. includes infra, provides environment for building, testing & deploying application without focussing on infra. DB management, business analytics. FOCUS ON APP DEVELOPMENT. 
SAAS - software as a service. Includes IAAS, PAAS and will give access to cloud based apps over the internet.  OneDrive.. its more of a finished solution. user pay for the subscription of software. 

REGIONS - 
Regions are made up of one or more data centers in close proximity. provides flexibility & scale to reduce customer latency. 
140 countries, 60+ regions. cost of doing an business will vary from region to region. Data residency requirements & compliances have to be meet. 

AVAILABILITY ZONES - TO AVOID DOWNTIME IN CASE OF ANY CALAMITIES. FOR DISASTER RECOVERY
Provide protection against downtimes due to data center failure. basically provide seperate datacenters within the same region. connected through private fibre optic. each data center is equipped with independent cooling, power & networking. 

REGION PAIRS - 300 MILES OF SEPERATION BETWEEN REGION PAIRS. AUTOMATIC REPLICATION FOR EACH SERVICE. PRIORITIZED REGION RECOVERY IN CASE OF OUTAGE. 
THERE IS NO EXTRA CHARGES FOR THIS. 

Azure US government services - sovereign regions 
Single instance of Azure. only authenticated and authorized can deploy. 

Azure China - Microsoft is first foreign Cloud provider to compliant with China. All data stays with china. physically seperated instance of azure cloud service operated by 21Vianet. 

Azure Resources -  components like VM, Storage accounts, App services, SQL DBs, Functions & virtual networks. 
Resources are grouped into folders known as resource groups. 
Resource Group - Container to manage and aggregate resources in a single unit. once we delete a group, all resources inside it will be deleted

cosmos DB - Fully nosql DB.  extremely fast in responding for small amount of data- low latency. Saas.
AZURE SQL DB - for sql db.

Resources can exist only in one resource group. Resources can exist in diff. regions. it can be moved to diff groups. App can use multiple resource groups. 	
NOTE : WHEN WE APPLY ANY SETTINGS/ACTION TO THE RESOURCE GROUP , SETTING IS APPLIED TO CURRENT AND FUTURE RESOURCES. 

Azure subscriptions - single account will have dev, test, production.
Billing boundary - generate seperate reports & invoices for each subscription. 
Access control boundary - manage & control access to the resource with specific subscription. 
MANAGEMENT GROUPS - INCLUDE MULTIPE SUBSCRIPTIONS. 
are grouping that help you manage access policy for multiple subscriptions. 
SUBSCRIPTIONS manage resource groups . a MANAGEMENT GROUP tree can support up to 6 levels of depth.. 

Virtual machines - when we are creating Virtual machines, other resources are created with it. for example Vnet. 

AZURE COMPUTE SERVICES - COMPUTING SERVICES THAT PROVIDES COMPUTING Resources such as VM, Disk, processor, networking, OS.
VM, App service, container instances, AKS , Azure virtual desktop. 

azure VM - software emulation of physical PC. IAAS - offering provides total control & customization. microsoft uses similar hyper-V

VM scale sets - provide load balanced opportunity to automatically scale resources. for improving performance, applications maybe distributed across multiple instances. we may access application through load balancer. 
NUMBER OF VMs that can be managed under a single VM set - 1000
VM availability sets - logical grouping of VMs that is spread across fault domains in one data center. 
EACH VM IN AVAILABILITY SET IS ASSIGNED AN UPDATE DOMAIN & FAULT DOMAIN by underlying azure platform. 
EACH AVAILABILITY SET CONSISTS OF 3 FAULT DOMAINS & 20 UPDATE DOMAINS. 

fault domains - based on common power & network. if part of data center fails, then other servers will not be taken down. 
update domain - logical structure of underlying hardware that can undergo maintainence and reboot at same time. systems are updated without any interruptions and without main service being offline. 

NOTE: DON'T ALLOW PUBLIC INTERNET OVER RDP,SSH DIRECTLY TO SERVER. USE SECURE SERVICE LIKE BASTION TO CONTROL ACCESS TO THE SERVERS BEHIND. 

AZURE VIRTUAL DESKTOPS - desktop and app virtualization that runs on cloud. can be used to create VMs that one or more users can use at the same time. 

Azure container services - light weight virtualized environment than VM. it doesn't require OS management. 
two types of azure container services --
azure container instances - a Paas offering that runs a container.  for managing one or two containers
azure kubernetes service - orchestration service for containers with distributed architectures & large volumes of containers. when dealing with lot of containers.  can easily scale up. 

Azure functions - serverless computing - cloud native code - it brings closer to business logic. cloud based execution environment.
Event based coding running your service and not the underlying infra..

Azure app services - full managed platform to build deploy and scale web apps and APIs quickly. works with  .net, php, nodejs, java, python. Paas offering.

VPN Gateway to be installed on company network to provide site-to-site VPN.

azure expressRoute - physical private connection between azure and on premise via a third party cabling. secure physical private connection.
it is more secure than VPN. 

Azure DNS - hosting service for DNS domains that provides name servers by using azure infra. by hosting domains in azure, can manage DNS records. 
Azure DNS security - based on azure resource manager, enabling role based control. 
NOTE: can't use AZURE DNS TO BUY A DOMAIN. 

STORAGE SERVICES -  
storage account
must have globally unique name. should be accessible(http,https) n scalable. 

AZURE AVAILABILITY ZONES -  physically & logically seperated DC with own independent power source, network and cooling.
 East US 2 region - is in virginia state.  

storage redundancy - to make highly availability.. every time we create a storage account, azure makes 3 copies of it.. the way 3 copies are stored and organized depends upon the redundancy configuration. 
LRS - locally redundant storage - 2 copies in a single datacenter in a single region
ZRS - zone redundancy storage  - 3 availability zones (copies of data in across 3 DCs in same region) in primary region 
GRS - Geo-redundancy storage- allows data to be in single data center in both primary and secondary region 
GZRS - geozone redundant storage - 3 availability zones in primary & 3 copies in single DC of secondary region. 

Azure SLA for two or more Virtual Machines in an Availability Set - 99.95%
AZURE SLA FOR 2 OR MORE AZURE VIRTUAL MACHINES THAT HAVE MANUALLY PLACED into different Availability Zones in the same region - 99.99%
 
3 types of data storages - structured - sql - relational , semi structured - json file.. mongodb type & unstructured - different from file to file.
 
1. CONTAINER STORAGE - BLOB STORAGE  - optimized for storing unstructured data such as text and binary data.. (PAAS offering) - not managing the server that is hosting..supports big data analytics. 
from the view of IAAS -- 
2. Disk storage - disks for VM, applications & other services. 
3. Azure files - highly available file shares that can be accessed by SMB (Server Message Protocol) 

NOTE : EVERY STORAGE SERVICE WILL HAVE A PUBLIC ENDPOINT. 

ACCESS TIERS - storage will also have access tiers.
3 types of access tiers - 
1. hot - optimized for storing data which is frequently accessed. -- high cost.. 
2. cool - optimized for storing that is infrequently accessed. & stored for atleast 30 days. 
3. archive - optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed n stored for atleast 180 days with flexible latency 

can switch between any tiers at any time.

3. Azure file sync - centralize the file shares... in azure files. automatically bi-directionally sync azure and premises files.cloud tiering keeps frequently accessed file locally n freeing up space. rapid provisioning of failed local servers.  

AZURE ACTIVE DIRECTORY - allows us to have cloud based identity & access management service. can be used with on premise. like azure portal (az devops)
features - Authentication (employee sign-in to access resource), SSO, Application management, B2B, B2C identity services, device management. 

authentication & authorization - 
authentication - identify the person seeking access to a resource. requests legit access credentials.
Authorization - determines authenticated person's service level of access. defines what data user is authorized to see and what they can do with it. 

Azure multi-factor authentication - using multiple forms of authentication alongwith password. can use authenticator app , voice recognition.

Multiple types of identity
1. External identity B2B - Partner, vendor, supplier or other collaborators get invited or self signed up  in Azure AD. your tenant.  collaborate outside of your organization with external users/partners. 
2. Azure AD B2C identity -  customer Identity access management - CIAM or CM. for customer facing apps. Signup, sign-in user flows, custom policies. seperate service from B2B. 
3. Conditional access - used by Azure Active directory to bring signal together, to make decisions, & enforce org policies. Manage access via device, IP location, network or group/User membership. 

Azure RBAC - Role based access control. Fine-grained access management. Seggregate duties within the team and grant only amount of access to users.

FACTORS AFFECTING COSTS -
Resource costs -  resource specific cost.
Consumption - pay as you go model. 
Maintenance - monitoring azure footprint & maintaining env can help identify & mitigate costs that aren't necessary.
Geography - same resource can cost different depending on geographic area 
Network traffic  - inbound data transfers are free. outbound data or data between azure resources is impacted by billing zone. 
subscription - type & configuration of your subscription can impact cost. 

Pricing calculator - lets us estimate cost of Azure products. for migrating estimation, this is not the tool for you. 
Basic configuration that we can include in the pricing calculator are region, tier, billing support.
Last thing that affects pricing is the subscription time. 

Total cost of Ownership Calculator (TCO)- tool to estimate cost savings can realize by migrating to Azure. report also compares on-premise infra costs with cost using azure products & services..
		total on-premise cost - 30 lakh dollars  in that 93% cost of data center.
		whereas on cloud - 5 lakhs -- 43% networking and 50% storage. 
	3 step process - 
		1. define workloads. enter details of servers. 
		2. adjust assumptions. IT labour cost, hardware costs, VM costs. 
		3. viewiing reports. 
		
AZURE COST MANAGEMENT - Reporting bill reports. create budgets, alerts based on resource spend. can restrict usage. Recommendation - cost recommendations. 

TAGS - Provides metadata for azure resources. Logically organize into taxonomy. consists of key-value pair. useful for roling up billing information.
