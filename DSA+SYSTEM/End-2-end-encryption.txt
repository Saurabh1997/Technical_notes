--------END-2-END-ENCRYPTION USED BY WHATSAPP-----------------

Public key cryptography - public-private key cryptography ----
	When A wants to send message to B, then A encrypts the msg using B's public key and then it is sent through SSH (TLS layer) to API server. 
	In this SSH layer, message is again encyrpted.. as its a secure tunnel..(channel). 
	DIGITAL SIGNATURE - TO VERIFY IF MESSAGE IS TRULY SENT BY A, AFTER ENCRYPTED..using  A's private key.. 
	
	Now, When B receives msg from A, it first verifies the digital signature using A's public key. and then decrypts the message using B's private key. 
	
When a new contact is added, we get his public key. Our private key is stored in our device only. 

SIGNAL PROTOCOL IS USED BY SIGNAL WHICH IS VERY POWERFUL. 
		-- each and every msg is encrypted with a different key. 
		-- double rachet..   
		-- also uses triple diffie hellman key exchange algo.
